# "Fusionify"

A website created in Spring 2020 as a Web Development practice project. 
Organized by "Filipinos Unifying Scientist-Engineers in an Organized Network", a.k.a. FUSION.

It is built with React (https://reactjs.org/), and developed by the following people:

## FUSION Team Organizer(s):
- Bien Salvania
- Cameron Sherry

## UI/UX Designers:
- Alfredo
- Dachelle Alo

## Frontend Programmers:
- Aljon Viray
- Lawrence Dizon
- Kae Ancheta

As of June 17, 2020, the website only works locally, meaning that you have to download all files/install dependencies
on your computer before attempting to run it.

Then, you must use the Command Window, use the 'cd' command to navigate to the folder of the project, and finally use 'npm start'
to automatically run the website on 'localhost' in your browser.
