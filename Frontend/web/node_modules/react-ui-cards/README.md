- Flipping card
  A card with a front and back side. Flips over on hover. Any React component can be displayed on either side.
  
  This card is a bit different than the other ones - it has no attributes. To define it, you have to create a nested structure and pass your content as children:
  
  ```javascript
	  <FlippingCard>
          <FlippingCardBack>
			  Content that will be displayed on the back of the card
		  </FlippingCardBack>
		  <FlippingCardFront>
			  Content that will be displayed on the front of the card
		  </FlippingCardFront>
	</FlippingCard>
  ```
  
  See demo page for an example in action.
